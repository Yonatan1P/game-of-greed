A python app that allows a player to roll dice, collect points, and gamble to beat the computer. 

We brainstormed a plan to begin the project. We worked on the logic for building the dice all together, and then split off into pairs for pair programming to work through the logic of the calculate score method and the Banker class. We came back together afterwords to compare and collaborate. The lab took a combined 3 hours.
## Day 1 (Version 1)
Monday-11/16/2020
Lab06
### Features
#### Game Logic Class:

Roll Dice - rolls 6 dice, and then incrementally less depending on number of dice kept

Calculate score - calculates the score of each dice roll 

#### Banker Class:

shelf method - adds the current calculated score to the temporary shelf

bank method - stores the shelved score into the balance when the round ends

clear shelf method - sets the shelf value back to 0 after every roll

### Testing
#### Roll Dice
When rolling 1 to 6 dice ensureâ€¦

[x]A sequence of correct length is returned

[x]Each item in sequence is an integer with value between 1 and 6

#### Calculate Score
[x]zilch - non scoring roll should return 0

[x]ones - rolls with various number of 1s should return correct score

[x]twos - rolls with various number of 2s should return correct score

[x]threes - rolls with various number of 3s should return correct score

[x]fours - rolls with various number of 4s should return correct score

[x] fives - rolls with various number of 5s should return correct score

[x] sixes - rolls with various number of 6s should return correct score

[x]straight - 1,2,3,4,5,6 should return correct score

[x]three_pairs - 3 pairs should return correct score

[x]two_trios - 2 sets of 3 should return correct score

[x]leftover_ones - 1s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score

[x]leftover_fives - 5s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score

#### Banker

[x]should properly track unbanked points

[x]should properly add unbanked points to total and return the deposited amount

[x]should remove any unbanked points, resetting to zero.

[x]should not affect previously banked point

Lab07

Game Simulation

We all worked as a group for this entire lab. The provided unit tests gave us a direction for coding, and we used the provided txt files to outline how our code should interact with the user. This, in conjuction with our previously built GameLogic, we were able to piece together a function that could handle our unit tests. Then we spent some time refactoring to make the code more modular and easier to read and debug. 

Logic Done in game_of_greed.game.py
### Features
Prompt user with option to start new game or quit
#### Roll Dice
Defined in the game_round_rolling_phase
Roll dice when user starts new round
Uses roll_dice function from GameLogic to generate the given number of dice
The rolled dice are passed on to the keep phase
#### Keep Dice
Defined in the game_round_keep_phase

From the given roll, users are prompted to input the numbers they want to keep

TODO: We still need to validate that the user's input is valid based on the rules of scoring.

The kept dice are passed on to the banking phase
#### Banking
Defined in the game_round_gambling_phase

For a given set of kept dice, we use the calculate_score function from GameLogic to calculate the score of the given kept dice combination.

The user is informed of the number of points they have shelved, and the number of di remaining for rerolling 
#### Rounds
This is handled between the gambling phase and the new round. 

If a user chooses to bank their points, then the next round starts automatically.

Every time a new round starts, the start_new_round method increments the round.
### Testing
Found in tests.version_2

all tests passing in test_sim_basic.py

mirroring the 4 sim.txt files provided:

- [x] bank_first_for_two_rounds

- [x] bank_one_roll_then_quit

- [x] one_and_done

- [x] quitter

## Day 3 (Version 3)
Wednesday 11/18/2020

Advanced Simulation

We forgot one feature from version 2, which was to give the user the option to roll dice again. This was a simple fix, once it was brought to our attention by Aliyah.

Again, we worked as a team to process through the tests that helped guide us through our logic. Many updates in this new version caused problems in previous versions, which forced us to debug. It total the lab took us about 6 hours in total, primarily because of a bug we found in our score calculator. Once that bug was found, it was easy to move forward through getting scorers. Once we had the proper scores calculated and we could get the scoring dice, we were able to validate the keepers, and accuse the cheaters. The Zilch case just took a simple if statement.

### Features
All implemented from version 3 tests
#### Get Scorers
In our game logic, we calculate the score with all the dice, and compare that to the each score that excludes 1 dice. If the excluded dice score is different from the all dice score, then the specific die excluded is a scoring die.
#### Validate Keepers
Also in the game logic, we run the requested keepers and the rolled dice through the Counter. If the user requests to keep more dice of any number than there are in the dice rolled, the user is accused of cheating or mistyping.
#### Hot Roll
In the game round rolling phase, there is an if statement that runs if there are no remaining dice (ie all the dice were kept), then it resets the number of remaining dice to 6.
#### Handle Zilch
In the keep phase of the game round, if there are no points calculated from the dice rolled, then a zilch message is printed and a new round is started.

### Testing
#### Test Get Scorers
- [x] test_get_back_one
#### Test Validate Keepers
- [x] test_validate_legal_keepers
- [x] test_validate_illegal_keepers
- [x] test_validate_illegal_overflow
#### Test Sim Advanced
- [x] test_repeat_roller()
- [x] test_hot_dice()
- [x] test_cheat_and_fix()
- [x] test_zilcher()
- [x] test_validate_illegal_keepers
- [x] test_validate_illegal_overflow

### Day 4 (version 4)
Creating Bots
#### Features
All team members contributed their own personalized bots to the bots.py file. All team members successfully created their own bots that were able to beat NervousNellie. 

- [x] YoniBot
- [x] MarkBot
- [x] BrendanBot
- [x] WillBot

#### Testing
Out of 100 games played, all of the new bots beat NervousNellie's score
No actual tests were written
